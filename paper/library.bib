The community of practice included individuals from academia, industry, non-profit groups, community-based organizations, and regulatory agencies. The group gathered to share knowledge developed from a variety of pilot projects in hopes of advancing the collective knowledge about how best to use low-cost air quality sensors. Panel discussion topics included: (1) best practices for deployment and calibration of low-cost sensor systems, (2) data standardization efforts and database design, (3) advances in sensor calibration, data management, and data analysis and visualization, and (4) lessons learned from research/community partnerships to encourage purposeful use of sensors and create change/action. Panel discussions summarized knowledge advances and project successes while also highlighting the questions, unresolved issues, and technological limitations that still remain within the low-cost air quality sensor arena.},

  abstract  = {With the development of information and communications technology, user-generated content and crowdsourced data are playing a large role in studies of transport and public health. Recently, Strava, a popular website and mobile app dedicated to tracking athletic activity (cycling and running), began offering a data service called Strava Metro, designed to help transportation researchers and urban planners to improve infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians. Strava Metro data has the potential to promote studies of cycling and health by indicating where commuting and non-commuting cycling activities are at a large spatial scale (street level and intersection level). The assessment of spatially varying effects of air pollution during active travel (cycling or walking) might benefit from Strava Metro data, as a variation in air pollution levels within a city would be expected. In this paper, to explore the potential of Strava Metro data in research of active travel and health, we investigate spatial patterns of non-commuting cycling activities and associations between cycling purpose (commuting and non-commuting) and air pollution exposure at a large scale. Additionally, we attempt to estimate the number of non-commuting cycling trips according to environmental characteristics that may help identify cycling behavior. Researchers who are undertaking studies relating to cycling purpose could benefit from this approach in their use of cycling trip data sets that lack trip purpose. We use the Strava Metro Nodes data from Glasgow, United Kingdom in an empirical study. Empirical results reveal some findings that (1) when compared with commuting cycling activities, non-commuting cycling activities are more likely to be located in outskirts of the city; (2) spatially speaking, cyclists riding for recreation and other purposes are more likely to be exposed to relatively low levels of air pollution than cyclists riding for commuting; and (3) the method for estimating of the number of non-commuting cycling activities works well in this study. The results highlight: (1) a need for policymakers to consider how to improve cycling infrastructure and road safety in outskirts of cities; and (2) a possible way of estimating the number of non-commuting cycling activities when the trip purpose of cycling data is unknown.},

In this paper a new approach is presented in which concurrently decrease the harmful effect of air pollution on vulnerable people and also reduce the wasted time of people in traffic. In this research Dijkstra algorithm is used to find the optimum path which is efficient in both aspects of shortness and air quality condition. Three different weights are assigned for network dataset to evaluate the sensitivity of calculated path in various conditions.},

  abstract = { Connectivity requirements are a common component of forest planning models, with important examples arising in wildlife habitat protection. In harvest scheduling models, one way of addressing preservation concerns consists of requiring that large contiguous patches of mature forest are maintained. In the context of nature reserve design, it is common practice to select a connected region of forest, as a reserve, in such a way as to maximize the number of species and habitats protected. Although a number of integer programming formulations have been proposed for these forest planning problems, most are impractical in that they fail to solve reasonably sized scheduling instances. We present a new integer programming methodology and test an implementation of it on five medium-sized forest instances publicly available in the Forest Management Optimization Site repository. Our approach allows us to obtain near-optimal solutions for multiple time-period instances in fewer than four hours. },

Comparing the models and the street network, we find that the streets of London form a self-organising system whose growth is characterised by a strict interaction between the metrical and informational space. In particular, a principle of least effort appears to create a balance between the physical and the mental effort required to navigate the city.},

Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.},

We will consider the case of the WCSPP defined on a graph without cycles. Even in this case, the problem is NP-hard, unless all weights are equal or all costs are equal, however pseudopolynomial time algorithms are known. The WCSPP applies to a number of real-world problems. Traditionally, dynamic programming approaches were most commonly used, but in recent times other methods have been developed, including exact approaches based on Lagrangean relaxation, and fully polynomial approximation schemes. We will review the area and present a new exact algorithm, based on scaling and rounding of weights.},

Our acceleration methods are allowed to use a preprocessing of the network data to create auxiliary information which is then used to speed-up shortest path queries. We focus on two methods based on Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path computations and two methods based on a generalized version of Dijkstra for constrained shortest paths. The methods are compared with other acceleration techniques, most of them published only recently. We also look at appropriate combinations of different methods to find further improvements. For shortest path computations we investigate hierarchical multiway-separator and arc-flag approaches. The hierarchical multiway-separator approach divides the graph into regions along a multiway-separator and gathers information to improve the search for shortest paths that stretch over several regions. A new multiway-separator heuristic is presented which improves the hierarchical separator approach. The arc-flag approach divides the graph into regions and gathers information on whether an arc is on a shortest path into a given region. Both methods yield significant speed-ups of the plain Dijkstra's algorithm. The arc flag method combined with an appropriate partition and a bi-directed search achieves an average speed-up of up to 1,400 on large networks. This combination narrows down the search space of Dijkstra's algorithm to almost the size of the corresponding shortest path for long distance shortest path queries. For the constrained shortest path problem we show that goal-directed and bi-directed acceleration methods can be used both individually and in combination. The goal-directed search achieves the best speed-up factor of 110 for the constrained problem.},

However, relatively little of it has provided systematic computational comparisons for a representative selection of algorithms. Furthermore, there has been almost no work showing numerical performance of scaling algorithms, although worst-case complexity guarantees for these are well known, nor has the effectiveness of simple preprocessing techniques been fully demonstrated. Here, we provide a computational comparison of three scaling techniques and a standard label-setting method. We also describe preprocessing techniques which take full advantage of cost and upper-bound information that can be obtained from simple shortest path information. We show that integrating information obtained in preprocessing within the label-setting method can lead to very substantial improvements in both memory required and run time, in some cases, by orders of magnitude. Finally, we show how the performance of the label-setting method can be further improved by making use of all Lagrange multiplier information collected in a Lagrangean relaxation first step. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In general, finding a path subject to multiple additive constraints (e.g., delay, delay-jitter) is an NP-complete problem. For this problem, we propose a randomized heuristic algorithm with polynomial-time complexity. Our algorithm first prunes all the links that cannot be on any feasible paths. It then uses a randomized heuristic search to find a feasible path, if one exists. The worst-case computational complexity of our algorithm is O(n/sup 2/), where n is the number of nodes. The storage complexity of the algorithm is O(n). Using extensive simulations, we show that our algorithm gives very high success rate in finding feasible paths.},

  abstract = { The elementary shortest-path problem with resource constraints (ESPPRC) is a widely used modeling tool in formulating vehicle-routing and crew-scheduling applications. The ESPPRC often occurs as a subproblem of an enclosing problem, where it is used to generate implicitly the set of all feasible routes or schedules, as in the column-generation formulation of the vehicle-routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). As the ESPPRC problem is NP-hard in the strong sense, classical solution approaches are based on the corresponding nonelementary shortest-path problem with resource constraints (SPPRC), which can be solved using a pseudo-polynomial labeling algorithm. While solving the enclosing problem by branch and price, this subproblem relaxation leads to weak lower bounds and sometimes impractically large branch-and-bound trees. A compromise between solving ESPPRC and SPPRC is to forbid cycles of small length. In the SPPRC with k-cycle elimination (SPPRC-k-cyc), paths with cycles are allowed only if cycles have length at least k + 1. The case k = 2 forbids sequences of the form i − j − i and has been successfully used to reduce integrality gaps. We propose a new definition of the dominance rule among labels for dealing with arbitrary values of k ≥ 2. The numerical experiments on the linear relaxation of some hard VRPTW instances from Solomon’s benchmark show that k-cycle elimination with k ≥ 3 can substantially improve the lower bounds of vehicle-routing problems with side constraints. The new algorithm has proven to be a key ingredient for getting exact integer solutions for well-known hard problems from the literature. },

Because of their simplicity, they are used even in commercial video games. But, the evaluation of work on grids has been inconsistent between different papers. Many research papers use different problem sets, making it difficult to compare results between papers. Furthermore, the performance characteristics of each test set are not necessarily obvious. This has motivated the creation of a standard test set of maps and problems on the maps that are open for all researchers to use. In addition to creating these sets, we use a variety of metrics to analyze the properties of the test sets. The goal is that these test sets will be useful to many researchers, making experimental results more comparable across papers, and improving the quality of research on grid-based domains.},

A salesman who travels between pairs of cities at a cost depending only on the pair, gets a prize in every city that he vitis and pays a penalty to every city that he fails to visit, wishes to minimize his travel costs and net penalties, while visiting enough cities to collect a prescribed amount of prize money. We call this problem the Prize Collecting Traveling Salesman Problem (PCTSP). This paper discusses structural properties of the PCTS polytope, the convex hull of solutions to the PCTSP. In particular, it identifies several families of facet defining inequalities for this polytope. Some of these inequalities are related to facets of the ordinary TS polytope, others to facets of the knapsack polytope. They can be used in algorithms for the PCTSP either as cutting planes or as ingredients of a Lagrangean optimand.},

  abstract  = {We investigate mathematical formulations and solution techniques for a variant of the Connected Subgraph Problem. Given a connected graph with costs and profits associated with the nodes, the goal is to find a connected subgraph that contains a subset of distinguished vertices. In this work we focus on the budget-constrained version, where we maximize the total profit of the nodes in the subgraph subject to a budget constraint on the total cost. We propose several mixed-integer formulations for enforcing the subgraph connectivity requirement, which plays a key role in the combinatorial structure of the problem. We show that a new formulation based on subtour elimination constraints is more effective at capturing the combinatorial structure of the problem, providing significant advantages over the previously considered encoding which was based on a single commodity flow. We test our formulations on synthetic instances as well as on real-world instances of an important problem in environmental conservation concerning the design of wildlife corridors. Our encoding results in a much tighter LP relaxation, and more importantly, it results in finding better integer feasible solutions as well as much better upper bounds on the objective (often proving optimality or within less than 1{\%} of optimality), both when considering the synthetic instances as well as the real-world wildlife corridor instances.},

Regular exercise plays a key role in improving some of the physiologic mechanisms and health outcomes that air pollution exposure may exacerbate. This problem presents an interesting challenge of balancing the beneficial effects of exercise along with the detrimental effects of air pollution upon health. This article summarizes the pulmonary, cardiovascular, cognitive, and systemic health effects of exposure to particulate matter, ozone, and carbon monoxide during exercise. It also summarizes how air pollution exposure affects maximal oxygen consumption and exercise performance. This article highlights ways in which exercisers could mitigate the adverse health effects of air pollution exposure during exercise and draws attention to the potential importance of land use planning in selecting exercise facilities.},

The problem can be formulated as finding a decomposition of an integer matrix into a weighted sequence of binary matrices whose rows satisfy a consecutive ones property. Minimising the cardinality of the decomposition is an important objective and has been shown to be strongly NP-hard, even for a matrix restricted to a single column or row. We show that in this latter case it can be solved efficiently as a shortest path problem, giving a simple proof that the one-row problem is fixed-parameter tractable in the maximum intensity. We develop new linear and constraint programming models exploiting this result. Our approaches significantly improve the best known for the problem, bringing real-world sized problem instances within reach of exact algorithms.},

  abstract = {Despite improvements in vehicle and fuel technology that have led to reductions in primary particle emissions, high PM10 levels have been observed in recent years in several European cities, including Athens (Greece) and Birmingham (UK). In certain cases, high PM10 concentrations have persisted over periods of several hours, resulting in exceedences of EU target values. In order to design effective PM10 control strategies, it is essential to develop an understanding of local and remote sources of particulate matter, as well as of the factors influencing its temporal and spatial variability in urban areas. In this study, PM10 data from Athens and Birmingham were analysed for relationships to other pollutants (NOx, CO, O3 and SO2) and meteorological parameters (wind velocity, temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, solar radiation and atmospheric pressure) during a 3-year period (2001–2003). Significant positive correlations between PM10 and NOx, CO, and solar radiation were observed at the selected monitoring sites during cold seasons. On the other hand, negative correlations between PM10 and O3, wind speed and precipitation were observed during the same seasons. However, these correlations became weaker during warm seasons, probably due to secondary aerosol formation and enhanced soil dust re-suspension. Furthermore, principal component and regression analyses were used to quantify the contribution of non-combustion sources to the observed PM10 background levels. This contribution ranged between 45% and 70% in Birmingham and 41–74% in Athens. Finally, several winter and summer PM10 episodes from each city were analysed using a back trajectory model, in order to identify the origin of the polluted air masses. It was found that long-range transport of particles from continental Europe had a marked effect on PM10 background levels in Birmingham, while the local weather had a stronger influence on PM10 levels in Athens.},

One such concept is that of a backdoor set---a set of variables such that once they are instantiated, the remaining problem simplifies to a tractable form. While backdoor sets were originally defined to capture structure in decision problems with discrete variables, here we introduce a notion of backdoors that captures structure in optimization problems, which often have both discrete and continuous variables. We show that finding a feasible solution and proving optimality are characterized by backdoors of different kinds and size. Surprisingly, in certain mixed integer programming problems, proving optimality involves a smaller backdoor set than finding the optimal solution. We also show extensive results on the number of backdoors of various sizes in optimization problems. Overall, this work demonstrates that backdoors, appropriately generalized, are also effective in capturing problem structure in optimization problems.},

The problem is classic but still attracts much attention because of its hardness and its prominent applications. Our work is based on the existence of an order of all the vertices whereby those belonging to a maximum clique stay close enough to each other. Such an order can be identified via the extraction of a particular subgraph from the original graph. The problem can consequently be seen as a permutation problem that can be addressed efficiently by metaheuristics. We first design a memetic algorithm (MA) for this purpose. Computational experiments conducted on the DIMACS benchmark instances clearly show that our MA not only outperforms existing genetic approaches, but it also compares very well to state-of-the-art algorithms regarding the maximal clique size found after different runs. Furthermore, we show that a hybridization of MA with an iterated local search (ILS) improves the stability of the algorithm. This hybridization (MA-ILS) permits to find two distinct maximal cliques of size 79 and one of size 80 for the C2000.9 instance of the DIMACS benchmark.},

Computational results for real road networks with up to 292 visiting places are reported, as well as for classical problems of the literature with up to 120 cities. Some of the latter problems have been solved for the first time with a pure cutting plane approach.},

  abstract = {Consider a set of nodes, each with an associated profit, and a set of arcs, each with an associated length. The objective of the orienteering problem is to find the path beginning at a specified origin and terminating at a specified destination that maximizes total profit subject to 1) a constraint on the length of the path, and 2) the condition that no node is visited more than once. The problem may be formulated as a 0–1 integer program, and it has been shown to be NP-hard. Prior research has focused on heuristics that obtain lower bounds on the optimal objective function value. Some recent research has proposed a branch-and-bound algorithm that solves a linear programming (LP) relaxation of the 0–1 model at each node and obtains an optimal orienteering path. Our research is concerned with tightening the LP relaxation by adding constraints and valid inequalities. We propose a procedure to obtain upper bounds by solving three successive linear programs. We test our procedure on datasets in existing literature and demonstrate that the average deviation between our upper bounds and the best known lower bounds (feasible solutions) is less than five percent. The quality of upper bound obtained is significantly enhanced over the bound obtained from solving the basic LP relaxation.},

In this paper we review the different classes of cutting-planes available, known theoretical results about their relative strength, important issues pertaining to cut selection, and discuss some possible new directions to be pursued in order to accomplish cutting-plane selection in a more principled manner.

The aim is to select customers and at the same time organize the visits for a vehicle fleet so as to maximize the collected profits and subject to a travel time restriction on each vehicle. In this paper, we investigate the effective use of a linear formulation with polynomial number of variables to solve TOP. Cutting planes are the core components of our solving algorithm. It is first used to solve smaller and intermediate models of the original problem by considering fewer vehicles. Useful information are then retrieved to solve larger models, and eventually reaching the original problem. Relatively new and dedicated methods for TOP, such as identification of irrelevant arcs and mandatory customers, clique and independent-set cuts based on the incompatibilities, and profit/customer restriction on subsets of vehicles, are introduced. We evaluated our algorithm on the standard benchmark of TOP. The results show that the algorithm is competitive and is able to prove the optimality for 12 instances previously unsolved.},

OSMnx contributes five significant capabilities for researchers and practitioners: first, the automated downloading of political boundaries and building footprints; second, the tailored and automated downloading and constructing of street network data from OpenStreetMap; third, the algorithmic correction of network topology; fourth, the ability to save street networks to disk as shapefiles, GraphML, or SVG files; and fifth, the ability to analyze street networks, including calculating routes, projecting and visualizing networks, and calculating metric and topological measures. These measures include those common in urban design and transportation studies, as well as advanced measures of the structure and topology of the network. Finally, this article presents a simple case study using OSMnx to construct and analyze street networks in Portland, Oregon.},

The OP is a routing problem in which the goal is to determine a subset of nodes to visit, and in which order, so that the total collected score is maximized and a given time budget is not exceeded. A number of typical variants has been studied, such as the Team OP, the (Team) OP with Time Windows and the Time Dependent OP. Recently, a number of new variants of the OP was introduced, such as the Stochastic OP, the Generalized OP, the Arc OP, the Multi-agent OP, the Clustered OP and others. This paper focuses on a comprehensive and thorough survey of recent variants of the OP, including the proposed solution approaches. Moreover, the OP has been used as a model in many different practical applications. The most recent applications of the OP, such as the Tourist Trip Design Problem and the mobile-crowdsourcing problem are discussed.

We present a simple approximation algorithm that finds a solution whose cost is less than 17 times the cost of the optimum. This improves upon previous performance ratios for this problem −O(k) due to Raviet al.,O(log2k) due to Awerbuchet al., and the previous best bound ofO(logk) due to Rajagopalan and Vazirani. Given any 0<α<1, we first present a bicriteria approximation algorithm that outputs a tree onp⩾αkvertices of total cost at most 2pL/(1−α)k, whereLis the cost of the optimalk-MST. The running time of the algorithm isO(n2log2n) on ann-node graph. We then show how to use this algorithm to derive a constant factor approximation algorithm for thek-MST problem.

  abstract = {At present, the most successful approach for solving large-scale instances of the Symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem to optimality is branch-and-cut. The success of branch-and-cut is due in large part to the availability of effective separation procedures; that is, routines for identifying violated linear constraints. For two particular classes of constraints, known as comb and domino-parity constraints, it has been shown that separation becomes easier when the underlying graph is planar. We continue this line of research by showing how to exploit planarity in the separation of three other classes of constraints: subtour elimination, 2-matching and simple domino-parity constraints.},

These variants include the traveling purchaser problem, the prize collecting traveling salesman problem, the orienteering problem, the median shortest path problem, and the covering salesman problem. The most important common characteristic of these problems is that the salesman travels the subset of customers, i.e., the tour does not necessarily visit all nodes as in the traveling salesman problem. We call this class of problems the subtour problem. In this paper, we derive several valid inequalities and show some of them are facets of the polytope of the subtour problem. Further we present several integer or mixed integer programming formulations of the subtour problem and compare these formulations in terms of bounds obtained by linear programming relaxations.},

A 1-tree is a tree together with an additional vertex connected to the tree by two edges. We observe that (i) a tour is precisely a 1-tree in which each vertex has degree 2, (ii) a minimum 1-tree is easy to compute, and (iii) the transformation on “intercity distances” cij → Cij + πi + πj leaves the traveling-salesman problem invariant but changes the minimum 1-tree. Using these observations, we define an infinite family of lower bounds w(π) on C*, the cost of an optimum tour. We show that maxπw(π) = C* precisely when a certain well-known linear program has an optimal solution in integers. We give a column-generation method and an ascent method for computing maxπw(π), and construct a branch-and-bound method in which the lower bounds w(π) control the search for an optimum tour. },

For a number of variants of this problem we show complexity results in the most significant graph classes. Moreover, we develop several heuristic algorithms for the k-card cut problem for complete, complete bipartite, and general graphs. Lower bounds are obtained through an SDP formulation, and used to show the quality of the heuristics. Finally, we present a randomized SDP heuristic and numerical results.},

With help from the operational law of uncertainty theory, this paper gives the uncertainty distribution of the shortest path length. Also, it investigates solutions to the α-shortest path and the most shortest path in an uncertain network. It points out that there exists an equivalence relation between the α-shortest path in an uncertain network and the shortest path in a corresponding deterministic network, which leads to an effective algorithm to find the α-shortest path and the most shortest path. Roughly speaking, this algorithm can be broken down into two parts: constructing a deterministic network and then invoking the Dijkstra algorithm.},

After proving that the problem is in the strong sense for arbitrary uncertainty sets, we focus on budgeted uncertainty sets introduced by Bertsimas and Sim (2003) and their extension to variable uncertainty by Poss (2013). We apply classical techniques to show that the problem with capacity constraints can be solved in pseudopolynomial time. However, we prove that the problem with time windows is in the strong sense when is not fixed, using a reduction from the independent set problem. We introduce then new robust labels that yield dynamic programming algorithms for the problems with time windows and capacity constraints. The running times of these algorithms are pseudopolynomial when is fixed, exponential otherwise. We present numerical results for the problem with time windows which show the effectiveness of the label-setting algorithm based on the new robust labels. Our numerical results also highlight the reduction in price of robustness obtained when using variable budgeted uncertainty instead of classical budgeted uncertainty. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.NETWORKS, Vol. 66(2), 98–111 2015},

  abstract = { We consider a class of routing optimization problems under uncertainty in which all decisions are made before the uncertainty is realized. The objective is to obtain optimal routing solutions that would, as much as possible, adhere to a set of specified requirements after the uncertainty is realized. These problems include finding an optimal routing solution to meet the soft time window requirements at a subset of nodes when the travel time is uncertain, and sending multiple capacitated vehicles to different nodes to meet the customers’ uncertain demands. We introduce a precise mathematical framework for defining and solving such routing problems. In particular, we propose a new decision criterion, called the Requirements Violation (RV) Index, which quantifies the risk associated with the violation of requirements taking into account both the frequency of violations and their magnitudes whenever they occur. The criterion can handle instances when probability distributions are known, and ambiguity when distributions are partially characterized through descriptive statistics such as moments. We develop practically efficient algorithms involving Benders decomposition to find the exact optimal routing solution in which the RV Index criterion is minimized, and we give numerical results from several computational studies that show the attractive performance of the solutions. },

  abstract = {As the global temperature has been increasing, the ice-covered area in the Arctic region has been decreasing. One of the opportunities to take advantage of the situation is the Arctic shipping between Asia and Europe. For economical and safe route selection, an ice navigation system is required for ships operating in the region, since the ice condition is changing hour after hour, and the ships sail long distances for weeks. Therefore, route selection by hand is challenging. The ice model in an ice navigation system simulates dynamic sea ice behavior, and its result is delivered to an optimization model for the path planning domain. During the map generation process for the path planning, both the ice model and the input data for the ice model have uncertainties, which cause prediction uncertainties in the sea ice behavior. For safety, the uncertainties should be considered carefully. Otherwise, accidents in the extremely severe conditions can happen because of unexpected events caused by the uncertainties of the prediction. Notwithstanding the safety issues, uncertainties in the ice navigation system have not been considered in previous research. In this work, the path planning problem in ice-covered waters is presented as a dynamic stochastic path planning problem by generating a map through the ensemble simulation of an ice model. And an uncertainty-based path planning model is proposed to find an optimal route under time-varying stochastic conditions. A heuristic path planning algorithm is employed, and different path planning models (stochastic vs. deterministic) are compared through simulations in two different scenarios for validation of the model.},
